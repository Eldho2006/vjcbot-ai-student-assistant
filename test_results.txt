I found the answer in your documents, but my AI quota is exhausted so I cannot summarize it. Here is the relevant text:

esign of such circuits.
Appendices B, C, D, and E illustrate how the instruction set concepts introduced in
Chapters 2 and 3 are implemented in four commercial processors: Nios II, ColdFire, ARM,and Intel IA-32. The Nios II and ARM processors illustrate the RISC design style. ColdFirehas an easy-to-teach CISC design, while the IA-32 CISC architecture represents the mostsuccessful commercial design. The presentation for each processor includes assembly-language examples from Chapters 2 and 3, implemented in the context of that processor. Thedetails given in these appendices are not essential for understanding the material in the mainbody of the book. It is suf∩¼ücient to cover only one of these appendices to gain an appreciationfor commercial processor instruction sets. The choice of a processor to use as an exampleis likely to be in∩¼éuenced by the equipment in an accompanying laboratory. Instructors maywish to use more that one processor to illustrate the different design approaches.
ChangesintheSixthEdition
Substantial changes in content and organization have been made in preparing the sixthedition of this book. They include the following:
ΓÇóThe basic concepts of instruction set architecture are now covered using the RISC-style
approach. This is followed by a comparative examination of the CISC-style approach.
ΓÇóThe processor design discussion is focused on a RISC-style implementation, which
leads naturally to pipelined operation.
ΓÇóTwo chapters on embedded systems are included: one dealing with the basic structure
of such systems and the use of microcontrollers, and the other dealing with system-on-a-chip implementations.
ΓÇóAppendices are used to give examples of four commercial processors. Each appendix
includes the essential information about the instruction set architecture of the givenprocessor.
ΓÇóSolved problems have been included in a new section toward the end of chapters andappendices. They provide the student with solutions that can be expected for typicalproblem...
